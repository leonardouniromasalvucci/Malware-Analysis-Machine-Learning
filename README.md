# Malware_Analysis_Machine_Learning

In this repo will be analyzed two common problems of compiler and optimization provenance. In particular,
given the assembly code of a function, I want predict the compiler and
the optimization used. It will be used a supervised learning approach given
a labeled training set, performing different models that allow us to predict
the expected values with different approaches.<br/><br/>
